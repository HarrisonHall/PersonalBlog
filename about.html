             <h2>Me</h2>
             <a class="norm">Updated September 2017</a>
            <p>Hey! You are currently viewing my personal projects website! Oh, by the way, I'm Harrison Christian Hall
             (if you couldn't tell). I'm a first year Computer Science at Clemson University, planning on graduating with
                a minor in both physics and mathematics. I'm in university clubs varrying from rocket engineering, 2D
                game development, competetive Super Smash Bros., ACM, cyber security, and Dungeons and Dragons 5e.</p>
             <p>Aside from my clubs, I have other interests and hobbies. I try to spend any free time I have learning or
               growing in one of my interests. My interests include computer science, computational physics, mathematics, 
               industrial engineering, materials engineering, data science, 3D modeling, digital production, artificial 
               intelligence, film/TV/photography, video games (including VR), politics, and super heroes. Some are of course 
               more productive than others. I plan on pursuing a career in my interests, most probably machine learning or
               computational physics, whether I work for company or create my career myself. </p>

            <h2>My library</h2>
             <a class="norm">Updated September 2017</a>
            <p>One of my fundamental beliefs is that the core human motive is growth. I know it is mine. Without growth 
             in my education or work I find myself feeling unsatisfied. If I'm not busy, I'm wasting time. I guess I sort of
             believe in Parkinson's law in that I will be busy no matter what. If I have 6 clubs and 6 classes I will be just
             as busy as if I had 2 clubs and 4 classes. That's why I organize my days the way I do. I try to read whenever I 
             have a chance. The library below consists of books I've read recently that I feel have had a fundamental impact on 
             my own development: mentally, spiritually, or academically.</p>

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>Me no good CSS. I hate to say I despise web development at a Comp Sci major,
            but I do. So... yeah. I tried for a miniamlistic look for the website, but I also
            don't have "good taste" in style. I tried, that's all I can say.</p>
