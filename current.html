              <h2>Ghetto Mansion</h2>
              <p>Ghetto Mansion is a comedy YouTube series I am working on with a few friends. It will likely begin 
             filming this Thanksgiving or Christmas.</p>
             <p>Blurb: Cory Richardson is a rich man. Very rich in fact. Rich enough that he wanted to buy his own mansion. 
               However, after visiting his best friend Carlos, the two conclude he is in fact not rich enough to build 
               in a high class neighborhood. The Solution? “Let’s build in the Ghetto!”</p>
              <a class="norm">This will eventually link to a youtube site</a>
