            <h2>Physics Notes</h2>
            <p>In an effort to learn LaTeX, I began writing some of my physics notes in the LaTeX language. While some notes are incomplete, notes for
               Clemson's Physics 2220 and 3110 can be found at the link below.</p>

            <p>For "fun," I have recreated cultivate using much better coding conventions. It is located on my github below. It only
              works in the command-line, however. It also allows for various garden sizes.</p>

            <h2>The Trial</h2>
            <p>Introducing the original text-based adventure game created by Harrison Hall,
            and Jacky Wong, featuring art from Olga Suchankova. The Trial was created in HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript and features a complex branch system to allow you to make your own
            decisions.</p>
            <p>The Trial stars you as the main character in deciding the fate of your hometown,
              Nubatormenta, as an outworldly ship lingers in the distance. Won 1st place in the 2017 Horry County Schools Tech Fair
              in Web Design.</p>

            <h2>Ardence</h2>
            <p>Ardence is a MOBA (multiplayer offline battle arena). Ha. I worked on this project with my good friend Biraj
            for the 2016 HCS Technology Fair. I worked on art assets and music for the game, along with other creative stuffs. Feel 
              free to download it. I was a junior in high school during this game's creation, so give me slack. Won 1st place in the
              2016 Horry County Schools Tech Fair in programming.</p>
